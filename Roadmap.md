- Add shim filter if replacers dont used in dependencies - maybe later, non-trivial.
- Add smart cache system by file hash - done
- Replace two file read to one buffer read - unneeded, no speed up detected
- Replace detective with self-writed class on acorn
- Add jade support - done
- Add more tests
